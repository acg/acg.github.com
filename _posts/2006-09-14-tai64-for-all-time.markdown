From Bernstein's <a href="http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html#tai64">tai64 page</a>:

> "Integers 2^63 and larger are reserved for future extensions. Under many cosmological theories, the integers under 2^63 are adequate to cover the entire expected lifetime of the universe; in this case no extensions will be necessary."

Phew!

Dealing with [multilog](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/multilog.html)'s TAI64 timestamps is always a bit annoying, but I suppose old djb may very well be laughing his head off in [2038](http://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php). Still, the idea of writing software "for all time" has enough allure to the developer mind that it feels like a trap.
