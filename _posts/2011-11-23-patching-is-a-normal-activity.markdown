title: Patching is a Normal Activity
root: ../../..
---

This morning, while adding some songs to my iPod with [gnupod](http://www.gnu.org/s/gnupod/), I hit a [bug](http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?34886#discussion).

The error message was descriptive enough that it took all of 5 minutes to patch and be on my way. Gnupod is not great code, but it's Perl, and unlike Rhythmbox -- which has a problem where it syncs partial audio files, and is a big fat gui program written in a compiled language -- I actually have a good chance of making it do what I want.

The two things I found interesting about this:

1. I prefer the crappier but hackable code.
2. Patching something seems like a perfectly normal activity in the context of "I want to listen to some music."
